<h1>Deploying Your First Website to GitHub Pages</h1>
Deploying a website to a hosting platform can seem like a daunting task, but it doesn’t have to be. With the right tools and guidance, anyone can deploy a website and make it available for the world to see.

In this article, I’ll walk you through the steps on how to deploy your first website to GitHub pages, from creating a custom domain to learning how to create great content. Whether you’re a beginner or an inexperienced marketer, this guide will provide you with the knowledge you need to create an effective website and make it live.

For this tutorial, you need a GitHub account and basic HTML knowledge. You need no prior knowledge of Git or the command line. (But if you’d like to explore and learn how to use these tools, check out Learn Git & GitHub and Learn the Command Line for Beginners)


What is GitHub?
GitHub is a popular platform for developers to share code and work on projects. It has a user-friendly interface that makes it accessible for beginners and a powerful command-line interface for more experienced developers. GitHub is often compared to social networking sites for programmers, as it allows members to follow each other, rate each other’s work, receive updates for specific open-source projects, and communicate publicly or privately.


What are GitHub Pages?
GitHub Pages, a tool provided by GitHub, lets you easily create and deploy a website online. GitHub allows you to store all the files and code for your website in a repository. You can then use GitHub Pages to generate a personal URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and share your site with friends, family, and the world!

GitHub vs. GitHub Pages
In GitHub, codes are stored in a repository or repo (short form). You can think of it as a special folder that lives online. GitHub serves as a housing to that folder so that it is accessible to you and your teammates from anywhere in the world.

For this article’s purpose, our repository will contain only HTML which describes the building blocks of a web page. But you can't SEE the website anywhere. GitHub Pages essentially connect your repository to a unique URL so that, when you go to that URL — say username.github.io — in your browser, you’ll find your website displayed.

Create a Repository
Let’s get started!

Create a new repository named username.github.io, where username is your GitHub username.



While creating a repository on your GitHub dashboard, you have the option to use a template, add a description, make your repository private, and initialize some additional files. These tools make it easy and accessible for other developers to learn about your repository.

Click! “Create Repository”

Creating Your First Website
Having created the repository in this format “username.github.io”, You should be directed to the new repository dashboard. Then, it is time to create a new file on that page. To do this, click the “creating a new file” link, and you’re good to go!!!


Kindly give your file the name “index.html”. Now copy the code snippet code below and add it to the “index.html” file you created previously.


Commits: These are referred to as changes made to your repository. You can think of each commit as a snapshot of your repository at different times or intervals.

Let’s create our first commit! After copying the code to your index.html file, click on the commit changes which then directs you to this phase.


While creating your first commit! You are expected to create a commit message but here you have got “Create index.html” as your commit message. You can add an extended description if you wish but it’s optional.

Click on the “commit changes” button to commit your file to your repository.

Outlook of Your Website 😎
Woah!!!! Your website is officially live and it’s now accessible at “https://username.github.io” (You must not forget to replace “username” with your GitHub username.)
